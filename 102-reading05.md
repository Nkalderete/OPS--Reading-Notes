### Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

- A shell is a user interface for accessing OS services, users interact with the shell using cli or command line interface. Terminal is a text line input and outpu. Command promt is a default command line interpreter for the OS.


### What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?

- (cd)-changes directories
- (ls)-lists content
- (mv)-moves files as well as change the names.
 

### What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?

- A absolute path describes where the location is from the root directory, a relative path describes the location of a file to the current directory.
- A '/' means "starting from ROOT directory"
- A '~' means "starting from HOME directory"
- The ROOT directory os the highest level of the system drive (contains OS, and all data on computer, including the home directory), the HOME directory is a subdirectory of the root directory (contains user files that are saved).


### Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.

- In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and the same types of software you are accustomed to, such as word processors, photo editors, video editors, and so on. In many cases, a software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. In short: if you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.

Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components. [source](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)
