## What is an ISO File?

- A single file that's a perfect representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD. The entire contents of a disc can be precisely duplicated in a single ISO file.

## How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?

- CD/DVD/BD burning software must "assemble" the contents of the ISO file onto the disc. Windows 11, 10, 8, and 7 can all burn ISO images to a disc without using any third-party softwareâ€”just double-tap or double-click the ISO file and then follow the wizard that appears.

## How do you mount an ISO file?

- Mounting an ISO file that you've created or downloaded from the internet is sort of like tricking your computer into thinking that the ISO file is a real disc. This way, you can "use" an ISO file just like it was on a real CD or DVD, only you didn't have to waste a disc, or your time burning one.
- Mounting an ISO file is usually as simple as opening the file with something called a "disc emulator" and then choosing a drive letter that the ISO file should represent. Even though this drive letter is a virtual drive, Windows sees it as a real one, and you can use it as such, too
