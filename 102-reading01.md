### How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
* Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, 
allowing external computers to tap into a servers code or sensitive information.



### What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?


* One, known as interdiction, consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit 
from manufacturer to customer. 

* The other method involves seeding changes from the very beginning.


### Explain how the hack worked.
* The chips were designed to look like other componets on the motherboard allowing them to be undetectable. also the chips opened the door for remote based computers to tao into the hardwares code even witht the unit powered off or crashed.


### How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

* American intelligence sources were reporting that China’s spies had plans to introduce malicious microchips into the supply chain.When Amazon found sabotaged hardware they gave access to the FBI to do full investigation.Boards have serial numbers that trace to specific factories. To track the corrupted chips to their source, U.S. intelligence agencies began following Supermicro’s serpentine supply chain in reverse
