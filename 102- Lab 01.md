### I/O shield
* The I/O shield is a part what allows for optimum air flow and grounding for the motherboard ports. The I/O shield helps ensure the motherboard is installed correctly and properly aligned with the case

### PCI slots on motherboard
* Peripheral Component Interconnect is a common connection interface for attaching computer peripherals to the motherboard. PCI was popular between 1995 and 2005 and was most often used to connect sound cards, network cards, and video cards.

### PCI-Express slots on motherboard
* PCIe slots allow your motherboard to connect with your PC's most critical components and provide key functionality. They also supply you with numerous customization and upgrade options when you're ready to venture beyond preloaded features like graphics and storage.

### Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU) w/ CPU fan
* The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results. The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.

### Motherboard, identify make, model, and specs
* The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a computer to work well.
* My un. it- Dell, GY6Y8 or KRC95. Dell GY6Y8
Socket Type LGA 1155/Socket H2
DDR3 SDRAM Compatible

### Random Access Memory (RAM) - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
* RAM is a temporary memory bank where your computer stores data it needs to retrieve quickly. RAM keeps data easily accessible so your processor can quickly find it without having to go into long-term storage to complete immediate processing tasks

### Chassis Fan - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
* Chassis or case fans, usually one exhaust fan to expel heated air from the rear and optionally an intake fan to draw cooler air in through the front
* My unit- Foxconn, PV903212PSPF 0C. 12V 0.6A chasis fan

### CD/DVD-ROM Drive - EXTRACT, identify make, model, and specs
* An optical disc drive (ODD) in a computer system allows you to use CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs to listen to music or watch a movie. Most drives also allow you to write data to a disc, so you can create your own music CDs, video DVDs or even create of back-up copy of your important data
* My unit- HL, model- GHBON. SATA DVDRW/CDRW

### Power supply - identify make, model, and specs
* These devices pull power from your wall outlet and distribute it throughout your PC. Without the right amount of power, your machine will not function how you need it to — and it may not even turn on.
* My unit has a Dell, H275AM-00. 100-240V, 50-60HZ, 5A.  FIXED OUTPUT +5V - 13A / +3.3V - 10A / +12VA - 17A / +12VB - 10A / +5VSB - 4A / -12V - 0.5A / +5V AND +3.3V ( SHALL NOT EXCEED 100W ) / +12V ( SHALL NOT EXCEED 240W )

### Case
* A computer case safeguards all of the important—and expensive—parts of a PC or other computing device. Internal components include things like the motherboard, chassis, drives, CPU and more for small desktop units
